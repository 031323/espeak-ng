----------

The Unicode Character Database (UCD) Tools is a set of Python tools and a C
library with a C++ API binding. The Python tools are designed to support
extracting and processing data from the text-based UCD source files, while
the C library is designed to provide easy access to this information within
a C or C++ program.

## Data Files

The `ucd-tools` project provides support for UCD formatted data files from
several different sources.

### Unicode Character Database

The following [Unicode Character Database](http://www.unicode.org/Public/9.0.0/ucd/)
files are supported:

*  Blocks
*  DerivedAge
*  PropList
*  PropertyValueAliases
*  Scripts
*  UnicodeData

### ConScript Unicode Registry

If enabled, the following data from the
[ConScript Unicode Registry](http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/) (CSUR) is
added:

| Code Range   | Script  |
|--------------|---------|
| `F8D0-F8FF`  | [Klingon](http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html) |

This data is located in the `data/csur` directory in a form compatible with the
Unicode Character Data files.

## Library

The `ucd-tools` project provides a C library with a C++ binding. This library
supports querying Unicode information about the codepoints in a compact and
efficient representation of the different data tables.

A ctype-compatible API is also provided, allowing programs to use that API on
systems that don't provide wide-character case conversion and ctype
implementations.

Detailed documentation is provided in the [src/include/ucd/ucd.h](ucd.h) file
using the Doxygen documentation format.

## Build Dependencies

In order to build ucd-tools, you need:

1.  a functional autotools system (`make`, `autoconf`, `automake` and `libtool`);
2.  a functional C and C++ compiler.

__NOTE__: The C++ compiler is used to build the test for the C++ API.

To build the documentation, you need:

1.  the doxygen program to build the api documentation;
2.  the dot program from the graphviz library to generate graphs in the api documentation.

### Debian

Core Dependencies:

| Dependency       | Install                                               |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| autotools        | `sudo apt-get install make autoconf automake libtool` |
| C++ compiler     | `sudo apt-get install gcc g++`                        |

Documentation Dependencies:

| Dependency | Install                         |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| doxygen    | `sudo apt-get install doxygen`  |
| graphviz   | `sudo apt-get install graphviz` |

## Building

UCD Tools supports the standard GNU autotools build system. The source code
does not contain the generated `configure` files, so to build it you need to
run:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make

The tests can be run by using:

	make check

The program can be installed using:

	sudo make install

The documentation can be built using:

	make html

## Updating the UCD Data

To re-generate the source files from the UCD data when a new version of
unicode is released, you need to run:

	./configure --prefix=/usr --with-unicode-version=VERSION
	make ucd-update

where `VERSION` is the Unicode version (e.g. `6.3.0`).

Additionally, you can use the `UCD_FLAGS` option to control how the data is
generated. The following flags are supported:

| Flag        | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| --with-csur | Add ConScript Unicode Registry data. |
